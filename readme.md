# Linguist 245 Project Files

## Overview

This repository contains code for reproducing an experiment, as part of the [linguistics 245 class](https://github.com/thegricean/LINGUIST245) at Stanford.
In particular reproducing [Bott and Chemla (2016)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749596X16300109).
The code focuses on the first experiment, but should be adaptable to all.

We use a template for web-based experiments developed and used in Noah Goodman's CoCoLab, etcâ€¦ you can see all of the relevant details in the original repository [here](https://github.com/Ciyang/experiment_template)
